  "question": "How to create a well-formatted multiple-choice quiz in Microsoft Word and a corresponding answer key for easy grading?",
  "answer": "To create a quiz and answer key in Microsoft Word, you should first use the Multilevel List feature for automatic numbering and professional formatting. Once the quiz is created, you can generate an answer key by creating a copy of the document and highlighting the correct answers or by compiling a separate list.\n\n**Part 1: Creating the Quiz Document**\n\n1.  **Set Up Automatic Numbering:** The best way to format a quiz is with a multilevel list. This automatically handles the question numbers (1, 2, 3...) and the option letters (A, B, C...).\n    *   Go to the **Home** tab.\n    *   In the **Paragraph** group, click the **Multilevel List** dropdown and select **Define New Multilevel List...**.\n    *   **For Level 1 (Questions):** Select '1' in the 'Click level to modify' box. Set the 'Number style' to '1, 2, 3, ...'. In the formatting box, type a period after the number (e.g., '1.'). It is recommended to link this level to a style, like **Heading 1**, for consistency.\n    *   **For Level 2 (Answers):** Select '2' in the 'Click level to modify' box. Set the 'Number style' to 'A, B, C, ...'. In the formatting box, type a period after the letter (e.g., 'A.'). Link this level to a different style, like **Heading 2**.\n    *   Click **OK** to save the list format.\n\n2.  **Write the Quiz Content:**\n    *   Apply the style for Level 1 (e.g., Heading 1) and type your first question. Press **Enter**.\n    *   Word will typically try to create another question. Press the **Tab** key to indent and switch to Level 2 (the answer options).\n    *   Type the first answer option. Press **Enter** to create the next lettered option automatically.\n    *   After typing all options for a question, press **Enter**, then **Shift+Tab** (or use the **Decrease Indent** button) to return to Level 1 for the next question.\n    *   Repeat until all questions are entered.\n\n3.  **Save the Student Version:** Save the completed document. This is the file you will print and distribute to students (e.g., 'History Quiz.docx').\n\n**Part 2: Creating the Answer Key**\n\nThere are two common methods to create the answer key.\n\n**Method 1: Highlight the Correct Answers (As shown in the image)**\n\n1.  Open your saved quiz document.\n2.  Go to **File > Save As** and save a copy with a new name (e.g., 'History Quiz - Answer Key.docx'). This is crucial to keep the student version clean.\n3.  In this new 'Answer Key' document, go through each question and select the correct answer option.\n4.  On the **Home** tab, use the **Text Highlight Color** tool to mark the correct answer.\n5.  Save the document. You can now print this version for grading.\n\n**Method 2: Create a Separate List (More efficient for grading)**\n\n1.  In the same 'Answer Key' document or a new blank document, create a simple list.\n2.  Type the question number followed by the letter of the correct answer.\n3.  Example:\n    1. B\n    2. C\n    3. A\n4.  This creates a compact, easy-to-read key that saves paper and makes grading very fast.",
  "summary": "This guide provides a step-by-step process for creating a multiple-choice quiz in Microsoft Word using the Multilevel List feature for automated question and answer numbering. It also details two effective methods for creating a separate answer key: either by highlighting the correct answers in a copy of the quiz or by compiling a simple list of the correct answer letters.",
  "note": "Using the 'Define New Multilevel List' feature and linking levels to styles is highly recommended. This ensures that your formatting remains consistent and is easy to update if you need to add, remove, or reorder questions. Always save the answer key as a separate file to avoid accidentally distributing it to students.",
  "more": "For more advanced quizzes, you can explore using Form Controls in Word's Developer tab to create fillable, on-screen tests. For analyzing or querying information within your saved Word documents, you could investigate tools like Coral AI, which allow you to ask questions about the content of a DOCX file."
